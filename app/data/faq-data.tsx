    question: "How much should a professional website cost?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Website costs vary based on one thing: business goals. A simple template site might cost a few thousand, while a custom-built growth engine designed for
        high traffic and conversions is a more significant investment. We focus on the latter. Our packages are priced to be a high-return investment, not an
        expense. <strong className="text-slate-500">You can see our transparent pricing tiers above.</strong>
